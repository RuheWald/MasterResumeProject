# MasterResumeProject
A place for all of my achievements that can be easily rebuilt into a new file with more focus.

I intend to learn the basics of GitHub by utilizing it to continue improving my job search.
My vision for this project is to have an HTML resume with fields to select that will filter out specific components so that a new file can be created, with a new name, containing only the unselected components.
