     <h2>Recent Project Experience:</h2>
     <h3>Mechanical Systems Design 1&2 - Capstone Project</h3>
     <p>
          With a team of three others, designed and built a precise mechanical system for
          measuring the center of mass of bullets to improve data collection at
          CCI/Speer manufacturing plant in Lewiston Idaho. Worked extensively with
          Excel, MATLAB and LabVIEW for simulation, data collection, and data analysis.
     </p>
     
     <h3>Thermal Energy Systems Design - Fishery Water Saving Project</h3>
     <p>
          Used Python and Git to simulate and design a piping system to pump
          water from a fishery on the U of I campus to the campus cooling tower.
     </p>

     <h3>Advanced Computer Aided Design - CATIA Lego project</h3>
     <p>
         Built a lego engine model by first creating CATIA lego parts and
         then using them to create the full lego model as a CATIA assembly.
         This project included animation of the engine being assembled and
         rendering of the completed assembly.
     </p>

     <h3>Senior Lab - Scientific Process Project</h3>
     <p>
          Measured wind speed and direction with a sonic anemometer and used MATLAB
          to sort data, build wind rose plots and analyze probability of wind patterns.
